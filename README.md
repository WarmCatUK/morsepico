<b>Really simple and basic text to morse code translator, using MicroPython and the Raspberry Pi Pico.</b>

All you need is a raspberry pi pico and a micro-usb cable. The code simply uses the built-in led to display text as morse code.<br>
See here for more info: http://warmcat.uk/?p=400<br>

There is plenty help online to get started with Pico, but just in case, see below:<br>
Ensure your pico is ready with MicroPython, see official guide: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/pico/getting-started/<br>
I like to use Thonny to interface with the Pico, it's nice and easy: https://thonny.org<br>
Once you've installed Thonny, select "Run" menu, then "Select interpreter...", choose MycroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico) from the drop down.<br>
It should autodetect the Pico.<br>
Copy/Paste the morse pico code into the top window and run, or alternatively download and open the file.<br>
